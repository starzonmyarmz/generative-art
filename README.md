Generative Art
==============

🖼️ Artwork that I've programmed to be generated, using tools like JavaScript and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). I also have a growing [library of micro tools](https://github.com/starzonmyarmz/generative-art/tree/main/library) to help out with some monotenous tasks.

🤓 Probably want to serve these locally using a server, such as [Statikk](https://github.com/paulirish/statikk).
